# Enhanced Bank Management System with Transactions

A comprehensive C++ console application for managing bank client records with full CRUD operations and complete transaction management system.

## üè¶ Overview

This Enhanced Bank Management System is a console-based application written in C++ that demonstrates **Functional Programming** principles for managing bank client accounts with advanced transaction capabilities. The system uses file-based storage to persist client data and provides a user-friendly dual-menu interface.

### üéØ Programming Paradigm

This version of the system is built using **Functional Programming** approach, featuring:
- **Function-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Pure functions** for data transformation and validation
- **Stateless operations** with data passed between functions
- **Procedural flow** with structured programming techniques
- **Modular transaction system** with dedicated menu handling

### üîÑ Future Development

An **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** version of this system is planned for development, which will include:
- **Class-based design** with proper encapsulation (Account, Client, Transaction classes)
- **Inheritance hierarchies** for different account types (Savings, Checking, etc.)
- **Polymorphism** for flexible client and transaction management
- **Design patterns** implementation (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
- **Better code reusability** and maintainability

This functional version serves as a foundation and reference point for comparing programming paradigms and understanding the evolution from procedural to object-oriented design.

## üÜï What's New in This Version

This enhanced version builds upon the basic bank management system with significant improvements and new functionality:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, or Clang)
- Standard C++ libraries
- Windows OS (due to `system("cls")` and `system("pause>0")` commands)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-bank-system-functional.git
   cd enhanced-bank-system-functional
   ```

2. **Compile the program**
   ```bash
   g++ -o bank_system main.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./bank_system
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Main Menu Options

When you run the program, you'll see a main menu with the following options:

1. **Show Client List** - Displays all clients in a formatted table
2. **Add New Client** - Add one or more new clients to the system
3. **Delete Client** - Remove a client by account number
4. **Update Client Info** - Modify existing client information
5. **Find Client** - Search for a client by account number
6. **Transactions** - Access the transaction management menu
7. **Exit** - Close the application

### Transaction Menu Options

The transaction menu provides:

1. **Deposit** - Add money to a client's account
2. **Withdraw** - Remove money from a client's account (with balance validation)
3. **Total Balances** - View all client balances and system total
4. **Main Menu** - Return to the main menu

### Sample Transaction Flow

#### Making a Deposit:
```
Please enter AccountNumber? A101
Account found - Client: John Doe
Current Balance: $5000.00

Please enter deposit amount? 1500
Are you sure you want to perform this transaction? y/n? y
Done Successfully, New balance is: $6500.00
```

#### Making a Withdrawal:
```
Please enter AccountNumber? A101
Account found - Client: John Doe
Current Balance: $6500.00

Please enter withdraw amount? 2000
Are you sure you want to perform this transaction? y/n? y
Done Successfully, New balance is: $4500.00
```

### Sample Data Format

The system stores data in `Clients.txt` with the following format:
```
